Really good start.

1. The response to the well LOOKS like it is from a high K inclusion, but it
isn't.  Can you craft a physical explanation that relates to a pumping well?

I like your observation about flow influence only being within the capture zone ...
but, be careful of this!  That is really true of the zone of influence.  Can you
try to capture the difference in your final answer?

Maybe reinterpret the meaning of the steep flow lines up/down stream of the well.

Very good description of the capture zone.  Go ahead and draw it in!

Your explanation of the elliptical shapes is partly right.  Right near the well they
should be circular.  Why aren't they??

Can you compare, quantitatively, anything about the boundary flow plots for the two well
locations?  What can you learn, in a larger sense, from the fact that the two boundary
flows are so 'close together' for part of the domain with the well that isn't centered
in the domain?
