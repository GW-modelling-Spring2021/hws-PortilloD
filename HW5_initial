Excellent start!  Very clean and complete work!!  I'd like you to rethink the
affected area a bit.  Why does it spread out toward the right boundary?  Be
careful of interpreting drawdown as gradient!!  You are right that the well
will pick up contaminants.  My follow up question to you is ... how will
the concentration in the well compare to that of the recharge water?
