Nice work!  Check your Keq calculations ... specifically the length of flow (remember Type I boundaries).  As a check, an inclusion that is the same as the background should give you the background K!

Some more to consider -

Why does the flow increase so much so close to the inclusion in the high K material?

Why are the flow plots symmetric (left/right up/down)?

What makes more difference ... a high or low K inclusion?
