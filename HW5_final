Excellent work ... 95%!  Be a little bit careful in some answers.  It is
better to say that the flow is slightly lower through the left boundary for
the 15/5 case rather than relatively the same.  It shows that you do see
that it must be reduced.  Also, be VERY careful not to interpret drawdown as
equipotentials.  You ahve flow vectors shown on your drawdown map ... do you
see why this is not correct??   I like your approach to calculating the
concentration in the well ... but, I'd really like for you to use the model
results to construct a mass balance for the well and try to figure out the
concentration that way.  It is often very useful to have more than one way
to come up with an answer :)
