In this case, we see flow at the top and bottom to be the same value. In the middle, however, the flow decreases dramatically. This is because the low K inclusion in the center allows for the flow to continue around these zones pushing only a small amount at a lower rate. So what does this look like at the center?"

This influeces the dip we see in Figure 1 which a smaller flux as a result of the low k zones."
