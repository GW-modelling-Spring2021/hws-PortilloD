    "## Model Description\n",
    "â€‹The model is set up for a homogeneous medium. The single-layer domain is 50x50 cells. The cells are 10 m in lateral extent and 50 m in vertical. There is a well located at [0,20,20] (layer, row, column). Recharge occurs at a rate of 5e-4 m/day across the domain. The left and right boundaries have constant heads of 50 and 30, respectively. The well is pumped cyclically. Water is withdrawn at 500 m3/day for 90 days and then it is turned off for 270 days. (Pretend that a year is 360 days long.) The simulation is set to run for 100 years."

Since the saturated thickness changes and the cells change from unsaturated to saturated, there is a non-linear relationship. We have the recharge affecting the head values and the overall mass balance changing in between stress periods. The saturated thickness b changes because the head changes due to the well drawing water and the recharge adding water. In turn the head changes in response to the b changing showing a change in transmissivity T. \n",
