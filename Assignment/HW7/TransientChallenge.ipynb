    "## Model Description\n",
    "â€‹The model is set up for a homogeneous medium. The single-layer domain is 50x50 cells. The cells are 10 m in lateral extent and 50 m in vertical. There is a well located at [0,20,20] (layer, row, column). Recharge occurs at a rate of 5e-4 m/day across the domain. The left and right boundaries have constant heads of 50 and 30, respectively. The well is pumped cyclically. Water is withdrawn at 500 m3/day for 90 days and then it is turned off for 270 days. (Pretend that a year is 360 days long.) The simulation is set to run for 100 years."

    "I htink this has to do with what we discussed about the convertible cells in MODFLOW. Since the saturated thickness changes and the cells change from unsaturated to saturated, there is a non-linear relationship. We have the recharge affecting the water table depth and the overall mass balance changing in between stress periods. The saturated thickness b changes because the head changes due to the well drawing water and the recharge adding water. In turn the head changes in response to the b changing showing a change in transmissivity T. \n",
