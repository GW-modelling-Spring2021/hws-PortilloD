As time increases with the pump on (never turning off any point), we can see the size of the orange circle increase. these are particles captured by the well.  I believe this shows the extent of the capture zone within the domain. Adn its very small actually, only taking in particles from surrounding the well (~50m in diameter)."

So in this case, volumes of water at the boundaries flow from high gradient to low gradient as usual. But the volumes of water are replaced by water from storage. ...I think. My model crashes if I run for over 200 years and I did not try anything between 100 and 200 years. But I think running a well for 100 years is RELATIVELY close to inifite!"
