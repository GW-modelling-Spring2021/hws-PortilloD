 Show equipotentials and flow vectors, and plot of steady-state ET flux (how is ET varying over the map) for initial conditions.
- One person to play around with extinction depth and see what difference that makes in the model.
- Other person to explain conceptually the difference between how ET is being modeled in MODFLOW versus how it works in real life
- Collective final challenge, start the pumping and examine how pumping affects ET in the MODFLOW model.  If we know the well's pumping rate and how much water is coming in from infiltration and from the boundary, how do we include ET in the mass balance of the well. Give a complete mass balance for the well that includes all sources of water, including boundary, irrigation water (recharge) and how you account for ET.
