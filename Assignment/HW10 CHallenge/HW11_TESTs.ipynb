    "The basic set scenario is as follows. There is a modeling-friendly mountain catchment, bounded by no flow boundaries on three sides. The downgradient boundary has been established as constant head based on the results of a larger-scale model. There is a municipal well in the basin. Some of the water used by the town is recharged after treatment, some is returned to the stream that runs through the basin. Recharge is associated with the mountain block. ET occurs in the basin floor and at a higher rate in the riparian area adjacent to the stream. An agricultural business has proposed to add a well and irrigate crops on a new field. You are to use the model to determine the risks of this in terms of agrochemicals reaching the stream, reduced streamflow, and additional drawdown in the town well. The model is run as three steady state conditions: No Town and No Ag (NTNA); Yes Town and No Ag (YTNA); and Yes Town and Yes Ag (YTYA). Some model parameters are known, others are unknown."
