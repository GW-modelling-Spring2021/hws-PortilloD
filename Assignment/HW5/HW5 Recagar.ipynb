    "The gradients are the same ~0.004 m/m. Flow is now not the same. This is becasue of how MODLFOW models unconfined aquifers; each cell now is convertible cell and can change the saturated thickness. For example, if our saturated thickness, b, is 10 m and we adjust the heads to 15 and 5, then above b we’d get a linear relationship (representing the unsaturated zone) but a nonlinear relationship when the flow enters the new b. This is seen in figure 1 where the blue curve behaves differently after Lx = 2000. Because we changed the head distribution and in turn changed the saturated thickness, which changes T, the flux must respond to meet the head distribution by definition of type I boundary. Flow is greater toward the right boundary and relatively the same on the left."

This illustrates ‘groundwater mounding’ where a shallower head gradient appears closer to the left boundary and steeper head gradient forms along the right boundary. The steeper gradient indicates an increase in flux across the boundary. The increase in flux is due to the changing head which is a result from \"adding\" the amount of recharge into the system.
